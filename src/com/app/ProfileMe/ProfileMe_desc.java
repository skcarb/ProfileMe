			+ " Your level of self confidence is about your feeling of being capable of completing an activity or an event,"
			+ " especially in new and unusual situations. "
			+ " The width of the face also impacts on how confident other people see you to be.\n\n"
			+ "It is measured by the difference between the width of the face and the vertical length of the face.\n\n"
			+ "To measure the width of the face, first imagine a horizontal line through the pupils of the eyes."
			+ " The width is measured between the points where the line touches the outer extremities of the facial skeleton,"
			+ " outside of the eye sockets, which is generally the same width as the distance between the outer ends of the eyebrows.\n\n"
			+ "The vertical length of the face is measured from the natural turn of the forehead (near the hairline) down to the tip of the chin.\n\nDivide the width of the face by the length of the face as shown in the sketch."

			"Does the person appear definitely wide or narrow faced? \n\n"

			"If you are not sure then consider the person to be mid level."
			+ " The more wider or narrower the face then the stronger either trait will be."
			+ " Type A, the narrow face has a width that is equal to or less than 60 percent of the face length."
			+ " Type B, the mid range is around 65 percent of the face length."
			+ "  Type C, the wide face has a width that is equal to or greater than 70 percent of the face length\n\n"

			"Type A has the trait we call “Builds Confidence”. By nature you are cautious. You gain your confidence through knowledge and practice. When learning new skills you have a tendency to take class after class to make sure you have enough information. When faced with a new situation or project you find you do better if you thoroughly learn about the project first. \n\n"
			+

			"When situations seem rather daunting, realize the fear is caused by lack of information and experience."
			+ " It isn't because you are not capable. Once you have gained the knowledge you need, you have all the confidence in the world."
			+ " When your partner has the opposite of this trait it can impact quite dramatically on the relationship.\n\n"
			+ "Type B is the mid range of this trait. More confident than Type A but less “gung-ho” than Type C. You are neither over confident nor are you lacking in confidence. You may be slightly reserved when confronted with new situations or events but you generally move quickly ahead as you gather more information.\n\n"
			+

			"Type C has the trait we call “Innate Self-confidence” and by nature you have a high level of confidence. You love a challenge and a life without a challenge is very boring. When faced with a new and challenging situation you will rise to the occasion, and may wonder why others do not attack new situations with the same zeal and confidence. Often you will just “wing” the situation or task and presume you will learn as you go along. If you fall flat on your face, you'll pick yourself up and start all over again. When your partner has the opposite of this trait it can impact quite dramatically on the relationship.";
